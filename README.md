Hello there ! 

Inspired and amateur coder here, freelancing my way through GitHub !  âš¡âš¡âš¡

I am mainly working on C++ , C# and Python projects, but definitely want to improve on other languages as well. Taking on challenging programming tasks and optimizing them is always exciting for me, since it requires more brain squeezing. ğŸ¤”

I absolutely love riddles and puzzles, especially math related ones. Always eager to learn and develop things I already know !

Collaboration offers are always welcome, from very small to very big ideas and projects.  ğŸ‘¯
